\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Dr.\  Jacques Carette for the guidance, encouragement,
contributions and support he has provided during my studies as a student. Your
expertise and feedback were invaluable in shaping my research. I have been very
lucky to have you as my supervisor and I have learned a lot from you. I would
also like to thank Dr.\  Ridha Khedri and Dr.\ Wolfram Kahl for being on my
supervisory committee.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the maintainers and
contributors of the Agda Standard Library. Your code review was very helpful for
critical thinking and pushed me to understand the subject better. 

Thanks to my parents Shanthala and Madhusudana, and my siblings Utpala and Anagha
for their endless love and support of me while I continue my education. Finally,
Thanks to my family and friends for all the motivation and support.
