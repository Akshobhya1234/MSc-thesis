Algebra is the abstract encapsulation of mathematical intuition. Proof systems
can be described as inference system that has provable statements or theorems
being their final products. It is important to study the intersection of these
powerful concepts in mathematics and computer science by carefully defining
mathematical concepts in computer language.

In this work, we study algebraic structures in proof systems especially Agda,
Coq, Idris, and Lean 3 to determine the coverage of algebra in these systems and
to set the scope of our research. We contribute to the Agda standard library, a
proof assistant system so it can be extended to other relevant fields of
algebra. We focus on commonly studied structures such as quasigroups, loops,
semigroups, rings, and Kleene algebra. These structures are well-studied in
universal algebra and have its applications in various fields including computer
science, quantum physics, and mathematics. In the effort of defining several
structures with their constructs like morphisms, and direct products and proving
it's properties, we analyze five problems that arise and may not be as relevant
in classical mathematics. We define more than 20 algebraic structures and add
more than 40 proofs to Agda standard library.
