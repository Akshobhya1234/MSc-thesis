\prefacesection{Declaration of Academic Achievement}

I, Akshobhya Katte Madhusudana, declare that this thesis is my own work unless
otherwise stated through citations or otherwise. My supervisor Dr. Jacques
Carette provided guidance and support at all stages of this work.

The major part of this thesis contributes to the Agda standard library. The library aims
to contain all the tools needed to write both programs and proofs easily in Agda
and has been contributed to by many developers and researchers before me.
